# IWU-BethelTech.Routing

Following best practices, I created four components in  four separate files. I created routing by using the <b>match</b> property.
Within one of the components, I created an unordered list that contained three links. Based on which link that was clicked, I rendered the item that the link suggested by using <b>match.url</b>.
